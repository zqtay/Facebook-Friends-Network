# Facebook-friends-network
This script automates the scraping of your Facebook friend list and visualises your social network using Selenium and Networkx.

## Known issues
As this script repeatedly requests for your friends' profile pages, Facebook will detect the automated process and temporarily block your account from accessing others' profile pages as the loop count increases.
